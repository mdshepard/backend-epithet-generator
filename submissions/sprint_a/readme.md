# Epithet Generator Sprint A
First phase of creating an API version of the Shakspearean insult generator, using Flask! It returns a random quip from the Bard himself! Prepare to be rattled to the core by quite an eloquent tongue lashing!

## The scaffold is complete
the basic framework for further work is complete. As it is, routes are set, and a payload is delivered. It may seem underwhelming at the moment, but in future implements you'll feel as though you're being condescended by the greatest wordsmith in the history of the English language, if you're into that sort of thing. If not, well, I'm sure there's a compliment generator out there for you. Have at thee, long shanks!
