# Epithet Generator Sprint B + C
First phase of creating an API version of the Shakspearean insult generator, using Flask! 
It returns a random quip from the Bard himself! Prepare to be rattled to the core by quite an eloquent tongue lashing!

## Operating instructions.

1. Run the flask app

2. The basic route will generate a single epithet in JSON format.

3. To view the entirety of the insult library: "./vocabulary". This will generate all 3 columns of delicious wordiness.

4. To generate multiple epithets, simply follow the path: "./epithets/#" where "#" is the integer representing the
amount of times you'd like your feelings to be hurt.

5. To keep yourself on your toes, and get a bit of a surprise, you can generate a random number of bardly tongue lashings
between 1-20. Simply use the path: "./random"!

If not, well, I'm sure there's a compliment generator out there for you. However, really, what's the fun in that though?
